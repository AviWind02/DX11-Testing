* Maybe Keep RGB bar on at all times
	and when clicked it'll Open : close the menu
	also allowing users to change its colour would be nice 
	but yes RGB bar should be the open button and to make it work i need to 
	the same method i used in Normal Menu for Option clicking, that should do it yes.
* Look into to simple icon or something like lolicon or keep the main menu the same menu right now
	If not then i could make the menu go up into the window or keep the side, keeping the side is the best thing tbh.

* added a few new things today
	added a function to check if mouse is held or hovering
	added it so user can hold and open and scroll change its int
	going for a more friendly way where user can use controller and mouse for all.
